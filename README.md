# microservices-the-one-project
## GOAL
Main goal of this project is to learn more about Microservice Architecture and how to implement it as well as learn how to write web applications in other languages.
As I've recently been playing Shadow of War, I've decided to write a system for managing Saurons army - The One system to rule them all :) 

For that I've decided to create one UI app (either web using Angular 10 and SpringBOOT or desktop using NodeJS and Electron) which will talk to the microservice backend. I'm planning to write most of the mechanisms required for microservices myself (as I said, I want to learn more about it and what better way to do so than to implement it) so I will not be using already existing libraries such as Netflix Hystrix, Ribbon etc. As I'm mainly Java and Angular Developer all this stuff will be written in Java using SpringBOOT while I'll try writing simple microservices in other languages such as:
- Haskell -> to learn some functional language
- Python -> because it's widely popular
- C++ -> because I've always liked that language
- GO -> just a gut feeling to go with it:)

I will also use Docker to run individual services and Docker-compose to run it all at ones.

The project architecture will evolve with time and I will try to document he whole process at [Dev.to](https://dev.to/digitalcrafting)
